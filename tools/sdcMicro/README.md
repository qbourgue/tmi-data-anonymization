### Rank swapping

> K0:
The algorithm keeps the change in the means of the variables before and after rank swapping within a range based on the subset-mean preservation factor K_0. The absolute difference between the variable mean before and swapping (abs(X_1 - X_2), where X_1 is the (subset) sample mean before swapping and X_2 is the (subset) sample mean after swapping) is kept smaller than or equal to 2 * K_0 * X_1 / sqrt(N_S), where N_S is the sample size of the subset under consideration. Therefore, larger values of K_0 allow larger deviations.
